# KITSU

Deployed [`here`](https://lynn89-sudo.github.io/red-panda).

This is a static Svelte site run on Github Pages and a demo project for a soon to be proposed YSWS, "The Zoo". Participants make a static Svelte app about any animal (real or not) and include 2 main pages/elements.

1: Facts Panel on the home page which must be cycleable and use runes to update. Unlocks other page when all facts are read.
2: Interactive animal, dynamic features and user interaction

I decided to make this demo about a Red Panda named Kitsu. I animated the tail for the interactive page, but the dynamic part was in the facial expression which changes depending on time of the day and attitude based on user action. It even has a secret attack (which I can't reveal, you just have to see it for yourself) if you annoy her enough.

Super excited to make a YSWS draft and tutorial on how to make a site like this in the near future!
